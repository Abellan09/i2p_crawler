The quintessential Internet service, the WWW, better known simply as
"the Web", has a hidden face that most users ignore.
Most of users browse the Surface Web (the content of the WWW that
common search engines are able to index). However, the Surface Web is just
the top of the WWW iceberg.
The great part of the WWW content is hosted in the known as Deep Web,
where all the content of the WWW that the common search engines aren't
able to index is hosted. Inside the Deep Web there are some \anonymous"
networks, called Darknets. These networks can only be accessed through
special configurations or using specific software.
Due to their names, these networks can incite people to value them with
the negative connotation of the term, but it doesn't have to be like it seems.
There are many other things than illegal and pernicious content in these
networks. Many of these networks emerged looking for freedom and privacy
(freedom of expression is not enjoyed in all countries). Although it is true
that there is no need to give a pejorative character to the Darknets, it must
be taken into account that these networks are the most hidden part of the
WWW, and where the level of privacy and anonymity is, without any doubt,
the highest.
This fact turns the Darknets into very interesting networks, due to the
implications of a very high level of anonymity. In fact, these networks are
experiencing a great boom, and their use grows more and more. The best
known, the TOR network, is the most explored, studied and analyzed among
all the Darknets. This is not the case of other Darknets like I2P, which has
been explored and studied to a lesser extent.
This project aims to study the problem of exploring and investigating
the I2P Darknet from the perspective and focus of the crawling. In this
project, it is going to be developed a crawler that is capable of extracting
the greatest possible number of eepsites as well as the relationships among
them, in order to create an interconnectivity map of eepsites that allows
drawing conclusions about the architecture of the I2P Darknet (if it has the
most scattered eepsites, if they are connected to each other and the network
is more or less centralized, etc).
